This is C::DynaLib, a Perl 5 module for calling C functions.
Example:

  use C::DynaLib;
  $libm = new C::DynaLib("-lm");
  $sinh = $libm->DeclareSub("sinh", "d", "d");
  print "The hyperbolic sine of 3 is ", &$sinh(3), "\n";

The module has been tested successfully on iX86, Sparc, and Alpha
machines.  However, there are probably compilers for even these chips
which will require some porting.  If you tell me, I might fix it.

Included are the following packages:

  C::DynaLib            - call a C function from Perl
  C::DynaLib::Callback  - convert a perl sub into a usable
                                     C function pointer
  C::DynaLib::Struct    - yet another tool for handling C
                                     compound data structures

To build this module, run the usual

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

Various things can go wrong.  First, your perl should be of the dynamic
variety.  Be sure you answered "y" when Configure asked, "Do you wish
to use dynamic loading?".  Otherwise, you will still (I think) be able
to create callback pointers and convert a function pointer into a Perl
sub, but you won't be able to do dynamic loading.

The biggest issue in porting this module is your system's function
call interface.  If Makefile.PL prints that it is using `hack30', it
is a sign that your system is not yet supported.  Another sign of
trouble is when `make test' prints `not ok' or `Illegal memory
operation'.  Further documentation in pod format is in DynaLib.pm.

The callback feature has sometimes caused grief in building the
module.  If Makefile.PL writes a makefile but you can't get it to
build, try `perl Makefile.PL CALLBACKS=0' followed by `make test',
and tell me of your success or failure.
