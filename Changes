Revision history for Perl extension C::DynaLib (formerly
ExtUtils::DynaLib, very formerly CLib).

0.01  Thu Jun 12 01:17:41 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02  Sat Jun 14 19:22:36  1997
	First release, only "cdecl" convention supported.

0.03  Sun Jun 15 22:56:26  1997
	Fixed problem with Perl prototypes.

0.04  Tue Jun 17 04:15:57  1997
	Generalized the default calling convention; constructor
accepts filename; declare_sub accepts function pointer; added ``hack30''
calling convention

0.10  Wed Jun 18 13:31:07 EDT 1997
	Got `hack30' to return ints correctly on sparc/solaris.
Made compatible with perl 5.003.

0.11  Thu Jun 19 23:43:29  1997
	Added sparc convention.

0.12  Sun Jun 22 10:34:21  1997
	Minor stuff.  Renamed to ExtUtils::DynaLib.

0.13-0.14  Nicified for CPAN.

0.20  Mon Jul  7 23:42:00  1997
	Support for callbacks.  Major and minor bugfixes.

0.21  Sat Jul 12 02:01:12  1997
	die works with callbacks (except in certain complex cases).
Added a few bits & pieces.
Sun's cc is now supported (thanks to lvirden@cas.org).

0.22  Wed Jul 30 01:12 1997
	Renamed methods to avoid possible future keyword conflict:
declare_sub became DeclareSub, poke became Poke, etc.  Added
ExtUtils::DynaLib::Struct package.  Got it to work on Windows 95 with
Borland C++ (but probably not repeatably ;-) )

0.30  Mon Aug 11 00:58:55  1997
	Added testcall configuration utility to find system
dependencies for cdecl convention.  Rewrote some docs.

0.31  Thu Aug 28 23:42  1997
	Digital Unix on the Alpha is supported, at least for gcc,
thanks to help from Achim Bohnet <ach@mpe.mpg.de>.  Added PTR_TYPE.

0.50  Sat Sep 27 01:35:55  1997
	Much nicification and many added arg/return types.  Rewrote
a lot of the guts.

0.51  Fri Oct  3 23:55:27  1997
	Renamed as C::DynaLib.  Fixed Makefile.PL bug that resulted
in NUL chars in DynaLib.c.  Errors in loading libs, finding symbols,
and allocating callbacks are no longer fatal.

0.52  Sat Oct 18 18:41:42  1997
	Some efforts toward portability, especially among Sparc
compilers.

0.53  Sat Oct 25 12:47:32  1997
	Improved error checking and reporting.  Function calls occur
in the sub declarer's package.  Second arg to C::DynaLib->new will be
passed along to DynaLoader::dl_load_file.
